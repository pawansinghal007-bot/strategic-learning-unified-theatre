## Sprint 54 reality note

Sprint 54 tag was applied to the auto-scan / drift-history sprint
(auto-scan.ts, drift-history.ts, security-overview:auto-scan IPC,
security-overview:list-drift-history IPC, preload autoScan and
listDriftHistory methods). The Human Tester Playwright scaffold was
committed immediately after without a new sprint tag. Sprint 55 covers
that work retroactively and adds the Vitest regression guard.

## Active

Sprint 56 (Human Tester 3) is complete.
Sprint 57 (Human Tester 4) is complete.

| Sprint | Focus                                                          | Status   |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 56     | Selector hardening with data-testid + Playwright stabilization | Complete |
| 57     | Human Tester 4: executive evidence pack — governance, security, knowledge, and local-AI readiness proof via Playwright and Vitest coverage. executive-evidence-panel added. data-evidence-surface and data-evidence-category hooks added. Playwright executive-evidence.spec.js created. Vitest guard sprint57-human-tester-4.test.js passing. | Complete |

## Remaining

| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 58     | TBD — candidates: BrowserPane overlap remediation, Playwright GitHub Actions workflow, CI smoke grouping for test:human:smoke and test:ui:theme, remaining legacy text-selector conversion. | Next |
| 59     | Playwright CI integration and artifact publishing  | Planned |
| 60     | Final workstation polish and packaging readiness   | Planned |

## Standing Architecture Rules (all future sprints)

- Never replace preload.cjs entirely — append/extend only
- Never add a second interface Window in types.d.ts
- Never reference dist/ paths in IPC handlers — always src/
- Tests are plain JavaScript (.test.js) — no TypeScript syntax
- Dashboard replacements must preserve all prior compatibility strings
- All IPC handlers use lazy require() inside handler functions
- Playwright tests live in tests/human/ and tests/ui/
  and run via playwright.human.config.cjs / playwright.ui.config.cjs
